# 📚 Java Curriculum Management System

This project is a **Java-based curriculum management system** developed as part of a Computer Programming / OOP laboratory course.

The main goal of the project is to model a university environment where **faculties, departments, professors, and students** interact to create and manage academic curricula.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design an object-oriented system that allows:

- Creating faculties and departments
- Managing lectures and curriculum structure
- Assigning professors and students to departments
- Allowing students to access curriculum and lecture details

The project focuses on **object relationships and system logic**, rather than user interface design.

---

## 🧩 Project Scenario

The application simulates a university curriculum system:

- **Faculties** group multiple departments.
- **Departments** define courses and curriculum structure.
- **Professors** can add or remove lectures and subjects.
- **Students** can view lecture details, list courses, and search for specific topics.
- Each user (student or professor) is assigned a **unique ID** to avoid duplication.

---

## 🧱 System Design

The system is implemented using multiple Java classes, each representing a real-world entity:

### 🔹 Faculty
- Groups departments together
- Acts as the top-level academic unit

### 🔹 Department
- Defines courses and subjects
- Manages curriculum content

### 🔹 Professor
- Can add or remove subjects from lectures
- Manages lecture content

### 🔹 Student
- Can view lecture details
- Can list and search subjects within the curriculum

### 🔹 Lecture
- Represents a course
- Contains lecture topics and details

### 🔹 Admin
- Creates lectures
- Assigns professors to lectures
- Manages system-level operations

## 📌 Features

- Faculty and department creation
- Professor and student registration with unique IDs
- Lecture creation and assignment
- Adding and removing subjects from lectures
- Listing lectures and subjects
- Searching for specific subjects
- Login mechanisms for professors and students

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance and composition
- Class relationships
- Console-based application

---

## 📂 Project Structure

The project includes multiple Java classes such as:

- `Faculty`, `Department`
- `Professor`, `Student`, `User`
- `Lecture`
- `Admin`
- Test and driver classes

Each class is designed with a **single responsibility** to maintain clarity and modularity.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience in:

- Designing object-oriented systems in Java
- Modeling real-world entities with classes
- Managing complex object relationships
- Implementing role-based system logic
- Writing clean and structured Java code

## 📚 Notes

This project represents my **early academic experience with Java and OOP** and is preserved to demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented design principles.
